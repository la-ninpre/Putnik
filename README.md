# Putnik Font

![Font Preview](preview.png)

Putnik is rough condensed cyrillic display font. It is primarily inspired by runic script, early cyrillic script and wooden pagan inscriptions.
This font is non-professional, though.

Font is made with Inkscape and FontForge.

## Glyph set

Currently there's not too much glyphs. There is cyrillic (all caps), digits and incomplete set of punctuation.

## Todo's

- all punctuation
- better kerning
- glyph polishing and tweaking
- maybe latin-script
